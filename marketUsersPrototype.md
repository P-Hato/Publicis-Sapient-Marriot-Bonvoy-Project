## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that users often have not settled on a destination for their next vaction. As the video shows, the user knows that they would like to take a vacation to a new location, but does not have an exact location in mind. A pain point present for the first user and the second user is that some destinations are not widely-known, which may confuse renters. Both users seem overwhelmed with the map present on the page, which may prevent them from renting.
